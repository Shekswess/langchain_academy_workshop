    "# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Google Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful applications enabled by LLMs is sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chatbots. These are applications that can answer questions about specific source information. These applications use a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show how to build a simple Q&A application over a text data source. Along the way we’ll go over a typical Q&A architecture and highlight additional resources for more advanced Q&A techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical RAG application has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. This usually happens offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval and generation: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the indexing portion of this tutorial will largely follow the semantic search tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing\n",
    "1. Load: First we need to load our data. This is done with Document Loaders.\n",
    "2. Split: Text splitters break large Documents into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and passing it into a model, as large chunks are harder to search over and won't fit in a model's finite context window.\n",
    "3. Store: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can be searched over later. This is often done using a VectorStore and Embeddings model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://python.langchain.com/assets/images/rag_indexing-8160f90a90a33253d0154659cf7d453f.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval and generation\n",
    "4. Retrieve: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a Retriever.\n",
    "5. Generate: A ChatModel / LLM produces an answer using a prompt that includes both the question with the retrieved data\n",
